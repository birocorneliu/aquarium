I tried to reproduce the steps but it didn't work for me. I changed to arduino code and the steps as follow:  
- Upload the arduino code
- First short circuit the sensor BNC connector
- adjust pot to read 512
- connect ph probe
- use rotterdam water ph 8.0, 20 degrees
- reading is r1 (570)
- use jus d'orange ph 3.8, 20 degrees
- reading is r2 (440)
- 8=r1*a+b
- 3.8=r2*a+b
- substract
- 4.2= (r1-r2)*a
- a=4.2/(r1-r2)  (0,0323)
- b=8-r1*a       (10,415)
- set a and b values in the arduino code

Important is to use fluids which are 20 degrees and wait a few minutes for the signal to stabilise. For now i got stable results.

I still don't know where the second potmeter is for and what the function is off the red LED (these two are connected with each other).
